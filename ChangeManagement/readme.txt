     Project Overview
===============================

Create a Change Management System (CMS). The Change Management System will allow the user to submit and process change requests.
CMS will be ITIL Compliant and will support all major changes types like Service Request and Standard Request 

Service Requests are the simplest of changes like "Password Change" etc. standard Requests are pre approved and do not require 
and approvals. Normal Requests require approval from Change Advisory Board(CAB).

Once a change request is submitted by the user, the operations group acts upon it.

Service and Standard Changes go through the following phases
Submit -> Assess -> Implement -> Verify -> Close

Each of the phases will have various actions depending on the change type, hence allowing the operations group to act and track
the changes submitted by the user.

Phase 1:CheckList : 4/22
